    <h1>John Baskerville</h1>

    <h2>Letter Founder & Master Printer</h2>

    <p class="intro">John Baskerville (1706–1775) was an English businessman whose entrepreneurial attentions included japanning
      and papier-mâché; he is, however, best remembered as a typographer and printer, not least for the design of the
      eponymous typeface which, to this very day, bears his name.</p>

    <p><span class="dropcap">B</span>askerville was born in the village of Wolverley, near Kidderminster in Worcestershire,
      and worked as a printer in Birmingham. Baskerville printed works for the University of Cambridge and, although an atheist,
      printed a splendid folio bible in 1763. His typefaces were greatly admired by Benjamin Franklin, a printer and fellow member of the Royal Society of Arts,
      who took the designs back to the newly-created United States, where they were adopted
      for most federal government publishing.</p>

    <p>Baskerville was responsible for numerous innovations in printing, paper and ink production.
      He developed a technique which produced a smoother whiter paper which showcased his strong black type. He also pioneered a completely new style of
      typography, adding wide margins and generous leading to improve legibility.</p>

    <blockquote>
      “Having been an early admirer of the beauty of letters, I became insensibly desirous of contributing to the perfection of them.
      I formed to myself ideas of greater accuracy than had yet appeared, and had endeavoured to produce a set of types
      according to what I conceived to be their true proportion.”<br>
